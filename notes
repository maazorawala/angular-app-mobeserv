    notes:

    How the angular loads the app and displays?
    the selector in app component file has name app root which is the tag that loads the data from the component

    script compoent are present in html file when we inspect which loads the angular and is the first code to be executed

    1. main.ts file
    -> bootstraps and starts by passing app module to bootstrap 
    2. module
    3. passes component 
    4. reads component nad passes the selector
    the index html file is loaded and the app root tag loads the data
    the app root has html attached from app component html file


    App module:
    angular uses component, uses modules to bundle into packages

    use a custom component:
    make another file with component name
    
    make a .component.ts and a component html file 
    
    import basic necessity required and name the selector which will be used to display the component by using the given name in a tag

    in module file import and give a name and define it in the decleration section. We are declaring, not calling and implementing.

    when the html in the custom component file is setup, call the component by using the tag in the main component
    
    We can only import one component on the index.html file because calling multiple component in the intial file will cause error and we do define which component to be imported first or focus on when the page is loaded. 

    create a new component : ng g c component name

    [] brackets to an attribute shows dynamic binding to some html attribute
    

    to do two way data binding in which angular returns the input answer on the spot. For that we make a variable in componentName.component.ts with empty string and we use banana brackets on the ngModel attribute and we set it to the variable name which we declared in the component file and use string interpelation to print the value
